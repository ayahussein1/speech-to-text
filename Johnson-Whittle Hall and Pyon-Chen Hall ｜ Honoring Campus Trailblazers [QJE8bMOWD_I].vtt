00:00.000 --> 00:08.360
From our start in 1856, the University of Maryland has been built by visionaries and

00:08.360 --> 00:11.520
shaped by fearless trailblazers.

00:11.520 --> 00:16.840
Hiram Widdell, Elaine Johnson Coates, Pyeongsu, and Cheon-Jean Constant Chen are four such

00:16.840 --> 00:19.520
trailblazers.

00:19.520 --> 00:25.760
Hiram Widdell was the first African American to be admitted to our university in 1951.

00:25.760 --> 00:30.120
Elaine Johnson Coates was the first African American female to graduate with a degree

00:30.120 --> 00:33.640
in education in 1959.

00:33.640 --> 00:38.880
The University of Maryland proudly presented them both with an honorary degree in recognition

00:38.880 --> 00:42.960
of their invaluable contribution to our community.

00:42.960 --> 00:49.360
Pyeongsu was the first Korean student to receive a degree from any American college or university.

00:49.360 --> 00:56.080
Cheon-Jean Chen was the first Chinese student to enroll at the Maryland Agricultural College.

00:56.080 --> 01:01.400
Today, the University of Maryland is proud to officially name our newest residence halls

01:01.400 --> 01:03.080
in their honor.

01:03.080 --> 01:09.440
Johnson Widdell Hall and Pyeong-Chen Hall will serve nearly 1,000 first and second year students,

01:09.440 --> 01:15.320
with single and double rooms in halls designed to maximize natural light, common areas, and

01:15.320 --> 01:17.400
study spaces.

01:17.400 --> 01:22.560
These four names will be etched in stone, a lasting testament to a legacy of their terrapin

01:22.560 --> 01:29.040
grit, resolve and a determination to succeed against all odds, and a fitting honor for

01:29.040 --> 01:33.480
four individuals who will forever be symbols of opportunity and progress.
