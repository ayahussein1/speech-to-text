The past year, we have been on a remarkable journey,

00:03.560 --> 00:05.720
moving fearlessly forward.

00:05.720 --> 00:08.360
The University of Maryland continues to excel

00:08.360 --> 00:10.680
thanks to the hard work and dedication

00:10.680 --> 00:15.680
of our students, faculty, staff, alumni, and friends.

00:15.680 --> 00:18.520
Together, we are taken on the world's grand challenges,

00:18.520 --> 00:22.880
united in purpose to improve the lives of all human kind

00:22.880 --> 00:24.320
and to do good.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.380
As we look ahead to the coming year,

00:26.380 --> 00:28.680
let's celebrate our collective accomplishments

00:28.720 --> 00:32.520
and recommit ourselves to creating a better future.

00:32.520 --> 00:34.200
During this holiday season,

00:34.200 --> 00:37.220
I hope you find time to rest, reflect,

00:37.220 --> 00:40.120
and cherish the moments with your loved ones.

00:40.120 --> 00:41.800
From our home to yours,

00:41.800 --> 00:43.440
may the holidays bring you,

00:43.440 --> 00:46.640
your families and communities, joy and peace.
