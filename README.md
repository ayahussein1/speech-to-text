The first video I transcribed was "University of Maryland 2023 Holiday Greetings!" it transcribed everything perfectly and smoothly.

For the second video, "Johnson-Whittle Hall and Pyon-Chen Hall | Honoring Campus Trailblazers," it translated the words fine, but it spelled some of the names of the individuals in the video wrong. It spelled "Hiram Whittle" like "Hiram Widdell," "Pyon Su" like "Pyeongsu" and "Chunjen Constant Chen" like "Cheon-Jean Constant Chen." However, it spelled "Elaine Johnson Coates" correctly. It was consistent in the spelling, but it was wrong for three of them.
